## ðŸ”¹ 1. Print Basics
**a. Print with Comma and Plus**  
Write a program that prints the following using both `,` and `+`:

Hello World!
Hello-World!
Hello World!

**b. Newline Character**  
Print the following using one `print()` and `\n`:
Hello
CS50P
Python

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Input & Output
**a. Greeting with F-string**
Ask for the user's name and greet them:
Hello, <name>!

**b. String Length**  
Ask the user to enter a word and print the number of characters in it using `len()`.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. String Methods
**a. Capitalize and Title**  
Ask the user for a name (e.g., "joHN doe") and print it:
- With `.capitalize()`
- With `.title()`

**b. Whitespace Trimming**  
Ask for a name with spaces and show the output using:
- `.lstrip()`
- `.rstrip()`
- `.strip()`

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Integer and Float
**a. Simple Calculator**  
Ask for two integers and print:
- Their sum
- Their product
- The remainder (using `%`)

**b. Float Addition with Rounding**  
Ask for two float numbers and:
- Print the sum
- Print the sum rounded to 1, 2, and 3 decimal places

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Round Function

**a. Banker's Rounding Check**  
Use `round()` to check and print the result of:
round(2.5)
round(3.5)
round(-2.5)
round(-3.5)

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Defining Functions
**a. Hello Function**
Define a function hello(name="World") that prints Hello, <name>.
Test it with and without an argument.

**b. Split Full Name**
Ask the user for their full name. Use .split() to separate first and last names and print each on a separate line.

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Return vs Print
**a. Add Function with Return**
Create a function add(a, b) that returns the sum.
Get two numbers from the user and print the result.

**b. Square Function**
Write a function square(n) that returns n ** 2.
Prompt the user and print the squared value.

# ðŸ”¹ 8. Bonus Challenge
**a. Formatted Division Output**
Ask for two floats a and b, compute a / b, and show the result formatted to:

 - 1 decimal place

 - 2 decimal places

 - 3 decimal places

15. Tip Calculator
Ask the user:

 - Total bill amount

 - Tip percentage

    Calculate and print the final amount with tip included (rounded to 2 decimal places).
