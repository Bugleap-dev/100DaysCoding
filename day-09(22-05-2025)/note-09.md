## EXERCISE

Exercise generated with chatgpt:

### 1: Number Comparison
Write a program that asks the user for three integers and prints:

- "x is the greatest" if x is the largest,

- "y is the greatest" if y is the largest,

- "z is the greatest" if z is the largest,

Or "There is a tie" if any two (or all) numbers are equal and greatest.

### 2: Grade Evaluator
Ask the user to input a score (0–100). Print:

- "A" if the score is 90 or above,

- "B" if 80–89,

- "C" if 70–79,

- "D" if 60–69,

- "F" if below 60.

### 3: Even, Odd or Zero
Write a function check_number(n) that:

- Returns "Even" if n is even,

- Returns "Odd" if n is odd,

- Returns "Zero" if n is exactly 0.

Then use main() to get user input and call check_number.

### 4: Hogwarts House
Ask the user for a name. If the name is:

- "Harry", "Hermione", or "Ron" → print "Gryffindor"

- "Draco" → print "Slytherin"

- "Luna" → print "Ravenclaw"

- "Cedric" → print "Hufflepuff"

- Otherwise, print "Unknown House"

Use either if-elif-else or match-case.

### 5: Divisibility Checker
Ask the user to enter a number. Print:

- "Divisible by 3 and 5" if the number is divisible by both,

- "Divisible by 3" if only by 3,

- "Divisible by 5" if only by 5,

- "Not divisible by 3 or 5" otherwise.
